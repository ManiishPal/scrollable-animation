        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that great design is not just about making things look
          beautiful‚Äîit's about solving real problems and creating meaningful
          connections between people and technology. Every line of code I write
          and every interface I design is crafted with the user's experience at
          the forefront.
        </p>

        <p>
          My approach combines technical expertise with creative vision. I don't
          just build applications; I create digital experiences that are
          intuitive, accessible, and delightful to use. Whether it's a complex
          web application or a simple landing page, I strive to make technology
          feel human.
        </p>

        <p>
          Continuous learning is at the core of my philosophy. The tech world
          evolves rapidly, and I embrace that change by staying curious,
          experimenting with new technologies, and always pushing the boundaries
          of what's possible in web development.
